Sagax

Sagax is a transactionally secure middleware able to manage communications between various end points or terminals and various clients and is especially well adaptated to brokered client to client, or client to intelligent end point communications.

Key Features

Can sanitize or scrub data from a client or endpoint before sending to another endpoint thus allowing data to be pertinent but anomymized.

Built to be adapted to any system of payment for which an adapter can be conceived of.

Comprehensive dashboard that provides clients with detailed transaction information and analytics
